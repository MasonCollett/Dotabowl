            <h3>How</h3>
            <p>
            Matches must be added manually during Dotabowl. 
            Statistics are updated live, leaderboards refresh dynamically, and achievements 
            are awarded as drainers compete.  No "in-game" stats (KDA, hero picks, etc.) are loaded. Maybe in a future release...
