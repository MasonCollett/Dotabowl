# About

Dotabowl (the website) is a player stats and match-tracking hub for **Dotabowl** (the event).

---

Matches must be added manually during Dotabowl.  
Statistics are updated live, leaderboards refresh dynamically, and achievements  
are awarded as drainers compete.  

No *in-game* stats (KDA, hero picks, etc.) are loaded â€” maybe in a future release...
